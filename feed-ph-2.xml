At long last, here’s the Ask Ezra Anything episode. You sent in great questions, and I answered as many as I could. To keep me honest — and to make sure I didn’t just talk to myself for two hours — I invited friend-of-the-show Grant Gordon back to the program to help out.

Debrief by Bloomberg: Obama wants to start a business after office?

The U.K. was poised for a referendum on whether to remain in the EU, and all the smart money was betting the answer would be ``yes.'' Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were slugging it out in the polls. For many people, a Clinton victory seemed all but guaranteed.

a16z Podcast: We Gotta Talk Pokémon Go
</title>
<description>
Seemingly overnight, a single game -- Pokémon Go -- has taken people by storm. But it's a game that was technically years in the making, building on a legacy of creative intellectual property and technologies such as mobile, geomapping/ geolocation, computer vision, and more. And since "toys are the prelude to serious ideas" [Charles and Ray Eames] or "the next big thing will start out looking like a toy" [Chris Dixon via Clayton Christensen], we want to understand this phenomenon beyond the hype and the hope: Not only is Nintendo stock soaring, but people are sharing amazing stories of massive public play, meeting strangers, saving dogs, fighting crime, helping autistic children.

  Ep. 160 - Ashlee Vance: Elon Musk and the Quest to Save Mankind
  </title>
 <description>
 He didn’t have permission.
 But he did it anyway. And one day Elon Musk called him.
 “He was either going to make life really horrible on me or he was going to cooperate with the book” said Ashlee Vance, author of the New York Times bestseller and Wall Street Journal’s “best books of the year,” Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.
 Ashlee did 200 interviews before Elon agreed, proving permission is not a starting place.
